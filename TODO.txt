Things to fix in current code, Embedded:
1. I2C_ARM.h & .c files need to have some ADC support like what was added (and working) last semester.
2. How to use this group 04 "10 byte" packet instead of the "4 byte" packet used last semester.
3. Get a new chair... I'm 24 for fucks sake... This shit shouldn't happen to my back.
